  <h2>About the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU)</h2>
  <p>
    The Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) is a vast and interconnected media franchise created by Marvel Studios that features superheroes, villains, and epic storylines spanning movies, TV shows, and streaming specials. Starting with <em>Iron Man</em> in 2008, the MCU has expanded through multiple phases, introducing beloved characters like Captain America, Thor, Black Widow, Spider-Man, and many more.

  <p>
    The MCU is unique for its shared universe concept — each movie or show connects with others through overlapping characters and events, creating a rich tapestry of stories. This interconnectedness means watching the MCU in a particular order can greatly enhance the viewing experience by revealing plot twists, character arcs, and Easter eggs in their intended context.
